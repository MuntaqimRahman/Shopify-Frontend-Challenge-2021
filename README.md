Thanks for checking out my submission.

I was a bit pressed for time, so there's certainly improvements that could be made over efficiency and styling.
I hope the application gives a taste of some of my frontend skills regardless of its issues. A particular feature 
is storing the nominations using my own local storage hook.

Some changes I would make include:
   Serving the API key with a .env file
   Updating styling and handling difference widths with media queries
   Using memoized functions when getting context data
   Saving to local storage only when leaving the application
